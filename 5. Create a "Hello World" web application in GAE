To create a "Hello World" web application in Google App Engine using Eclipse, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Eclipse: Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers from the Eclipse website (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

2. Install the Google Cloud Tools Plugin: Launch Eclipse and go to "Help" > "Eclipse Marketplace". Search for "Google Cloud Tools" and install the plugin.

3. Create a new Google App Engine project: Go to "File" > "New" > "Other". In the wizard, expand "Google Cloud" and select "App Engine Standard Java Project".

4. Configure project details: Enter a project name, package, and location for your project. Choose the appropriate runtime and click "Finish".

5. Create a Servlet class: Right-click on the "src" folder in the project, go to "New" > "Servlet", and enter a name for the Servlet class (e.g., "HelloWorldServlet"). Implement the `doGet` method to display the "Hello World" message.

6. Configure the web.xml file: Open the "web.xml" file located in the "WebContent/WEB-INF" folder. Add the servlet mapping to map the Servlet class to a URL pattern (e.g., `/hello`).

7. Deploy the application: Right-click on the project, go to "Google" > "Deploy to App Engine Standard". Select your Google Cloud Platform project, choose a deployment configuration, and click "Finish".

8. Verify the deployment: Once the deployment is complete, Eclipse will show the deployment details. Verify that the application is deployed successfully.

9. Access the web application: Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Google App Engine. Append the URL pattern defined in the web.xml file (e.g., `https://your-project-id.appspot.com/hello`).

10. Verify "Hello World" message: The web browser should display the "Hello World" message generated by the Servlet.
